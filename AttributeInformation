resting ECG result= The resting ECG can detect certain heart conditions such as hypertrophy of heart, ischemia, myocardial infarction, sequelae of myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, etc.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) test measures the electrical activity of the heart. A normal resting heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute.

max heart reat = the max healthy limit is 185-200(depending on age) during exercise

exercise induced angina = Angina is a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. Angina is a symptom of coronary artery disease.

oldpeak = ( ST-segment depression is believed as a common ECG sign of myocardial ischemia during exercise testing. 
Ischemia is a condition in which the blood flow (and thus oxygen) is restricted or reduced in a part of the body. 
Cardiac ischemia is the name for decreased blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle.
st tepression = ST depression represents myocardial ischemia or an emergent condition

the slope of the peak exercise ST segment = ST segment shift relative to exercise-induced increments in heart rate, the ST/heart rate slope (ST/HR slope),
has been proposed as a more accurate ECG criterion for diagnosing significant coronary artery disease (CAD).
The leads facing the injured cardiac muscle cells will record the action potential as ST elevation during systole while during diastole. 
ST segment elevation is regarded as a sign of myocardial ischemia.

downsloping ST-segment depression is a common manifestation of severe myocardial ischemia
up-sloping ST-segment depression has been increasingly recognized as a sign of ischemia,
