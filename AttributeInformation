chest pain type: 
Angina is a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart
TA = Typical Angina
ATA = Atypical Angina
NAP = Non-Anginal Pain
ASY = Asymptomatic

resting ECG result = The resting ECG can detect certain heart conditions such as hypertrophy of heart, ischemia, myocardial infarction, sequelae of myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, etc.
-Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a thickening of the wall of the heart's main pumping chamber. 
-ST Sinus tachycardia refers to a faster-than-usual heart rhythm. Your heart has a natural pacemaker called the sinus node,
which generates electrical impulses that move through your heart muscle and cause it to contract, or beat.

max heart reat = the max healthy limit is 185-200(depending on age) during exercise

exercise induced angina = Angina is a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. Angina is a symptom of coronary artery disease.

oldpeak = ( ST-segment depression is believed as a common ECG sign of myocardial ischemia during exercise testing. 
 -Ischemia is a condition in which the blood flow (and thus oxygen) is restricted or reduced in a part of the body. 
 -Cardiac ischemia is the name for decreased blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle.
 -st tepression = ST depression represents myocardial ischemia or an emergent condition

the slope of the peak exercise ST segment = ST segment shift relative to exercise-induced increments in heart rate, the ST/heart rate slope (ST/HR slope),
 -has been proposed as a more accurate ECG criterion for diagnosing significant coronary artery disease (CAD).
 -The leads facing the injured cardiac muscle cells will record the action potential as ST elevation during systole while during diastole. 
 -ST segment elevation is regarded as a sign of myocardial ischemia.

 -downsloping ST-segment depression is a common manifestation of severe myocardial ischemia
 -up-sloping ST-segment depression has been increasingly recognized as a sign of ischemia,
